# Insertion-sorthing-algorithm

The insertion sorting algorithm works as follows by first cheching the 
index 0 and the index 1 of the array, 
if the index 1 is smaller that the inde 0, they swap places.
Continueing, starting by index 3,
a comparison is made for each previous item in the array, and the same rule is been aplyed, 
for each one that is smaller, they swap places.
The same procces continues for each item. 
Once this proccess is finished for the last item, the array is successfully sorted
